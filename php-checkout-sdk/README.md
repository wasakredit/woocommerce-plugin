### What's new in 2.5

The *Create Product Widget* has got a replacement function called *Get Monthly Cost Widget*, which will result in a more clean and simple look that is easier to style to your needs.

### What's new in 2.4

Minor update with respect to a missing semicolon.

### What's new in 2.3

Added new operation "Get Payment Methods". This can be used for a more detailed description of the Wasa Kredit Checkout payment method.  
Resolve an issue with session scoping when running multiple partners on the same session/domain.

### What's new in v2.2

New generic operation names matching api changes.  
Added tracking of SDK and Plugin version to header of API calls.  

### What's new in v2.1

Added support for the missing endpoints *Get Order Status* and *Update Order Status*.
Also documentation for *Add Order Reference* is now in place.

### What's new in v2.0

Custom callbacks on events from the Checkout has been introduced.  
The snippet from create_checkout will no longer auto initialize the checkout.  
This to allow the integrating partner to be able to handle the callbacks manually.

## Getting Started

This documentation is about the PHP SDK for communicating with Wasa Kredit checkout services.

### Prerequisites

  * Partner credentials
  * PHP 5.7 or above

### Acquiring the SDK

You can apply to receive Partner credentials by sending a mail to [ehandel@wasakredit.se](mailto:ehandel@wasakredit.se).

### Initialization

Initialize the main *Client* class by passing in your issued *Client ID* and *Client Secret*.
You can optionally supply a *Test Mode* parameter which is by default is set to true.

```
 /**
  * Checks if the input is valid JSON or not   
  * @param   string       clientId
  * @param   string       clientSecret
  * @param   boolean      testMode
  *
  * @return Client
  */  

new Client({CLIENT ID}, {CLIENT SECRET}, {TEST MODE})
```

### Client

Orchestrates the main flow. *Client* will fetch and store an access token upon an initial request and save it in a PHP session for future requests.

#### Example

```
$this->_client = new Client(clientId, clientSecret, testMode);
```

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| clientId | *string* (required) | The client id that has been issued by Wasa Kredit |
| clientSecret | *string* (required) | Your client secret issued by Wasa Kredit |
| testMode | *boolean* | A boolean value if SDK should make requests in test mode or not |

  'ping_url' => 'https://YOUR-BASE-DOMAIN/ping-callback/'
);           

$response = $this->_client->create_checkout($payload);
```

##### Initialize checkout

After creating a Wasa Kredit Checkout by calling the `create_checkout` function and embedding the resulting html snippet in your web page, as described above, the checkout html snippet needs to be explicitly initialized through a javascript call to the global `window.wasaCheckout.init()` function. The `init` method call will populate the \<div\> contained in the html snippet and link it to an internal iframe.

```javascript
<script>
    window.wasaCheckout.init();
</script>
```

##### <a name="handle_custom_callbacks"></a>Handling custom checkout callbacks

Optionally, you're able to pass an options object to the `init`-function. Use this if you want to manually handle the onComplete, onRedirect and onCancel events.

```javascript
<script>
    var options = {
      onComplete: function(orderReferences){
        //[...]
      },
      onRedirect: function(orderReferences){
        //[...]
      },
      onCancel: function(orderReferences){
        //[...]
      }
    };   
    window.wasaCheckout.init(options);
</script>
```

The `onComplete` event will be raised when a User has completed the checkout process. We recommend that you convert your cart/checkout to an order here if you haven't done it already.

The `onRedirect` event will be raised the user clicks the "back to store/proceed"-button. The default behaviour will redirect the user to the `confirmation_callback_url` passed into the `create_checkout`-function.

The `onCancel` event will be raised if the checkout process is canceled by the user or Wasa Kredit.

All callback functions will get the `orderReferences` parameter passed from the checkout. This parameter consists of an Array of `KeyValue` objects.
These are the same values as the ones that was passed to the `create_checkout`-function as the `order_references` property.

```javascript
orderReferences = [
  { key: "partner_checkout_id", value: "900123" },
  { key: "partner_reserved_order_number", value: "123456" }
];    
```

### <a name="validate_financed_amount"></a>Validate Financed Amount

```
public function validate_financed_amount($amount)
```

#### Parameters
